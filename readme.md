## üß† What is Exa?

[Exa](https://exa.ai) is a developer-first search API that allows you to build semantic and keyword-based search directly into your applications. It gives you fine-grained control over the domains, number of results, types of search (keyword vs semantic), and more.

To use this script, you‚Äôll need to:

* Create an account on [https://exa.ai](https://exa.ai)
* Retrieve your API key from your dashboard
* Replace `'YOUR KEY'` in the script with your actual key

## ‚öôÔ∏è Modifications You Can Make

You can easily modify the script to tailor the search results to your needs:

* **Add more domains**:
  You can include more domains like Instagram, Medium, etc.

  ```python
  include_domains=[
    'https://www.reddit.com',
    'https://www.instagram.com',
    'https://medium.com',
  ]
  ```

* **Change number of results**:
  Increase or decrease the number of results.

  ```python
  num_results=10  # change from 5 to 10
  ```

* **Use semantic search instead of keyword search**:

  ```python
  type='semantic'  # instead of 'keyword'
  ```

* **Filter by specific time ranges (if supported)** or other metadata by exploring more parameters from the Exa documentation.
